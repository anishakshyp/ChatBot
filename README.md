# Mental Health Chatbot 
The goal of this project is to build a chatbot that can have a conversation with users regarding mental health providing emotional support. The chatbot is designed to understand user's inquiries about mental health and respond with helpful information or resources.

This Chatbot uses a Neural Network trained on the *intents.json* file to understand user's inquiries about mental health. The Neural Network is trained using the *PyTorch* library. The Chatbot uses the *nltk* library for Natural language processing, including tokenization, stemming and bag of words model.

The Chatbot can be trained by running the *Chatbot.ipynb* file. Once trained, the model is saved as a pickle file, which can be loaded and used for chatbot response generation.
